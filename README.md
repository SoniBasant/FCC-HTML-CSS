This depository contains paintings, logo, photos, screen shots and video. All are parts of projects I made for "Responsive Web Design Certification" course on freecodecamp (FCC).

I made five projects for this certification course.

- Survey Form (Northeast Tourist Survey Form)
- Project Landing Page (COLORKEEPERS)
- Technical Documentation (JavaScript)
- Personal Portfolio Project (My portfolio; NOT EXACTLY, I made this only for this course, did not included many projects. My original Portfolio is under progress.)

All projects are made on CodePen platform.
